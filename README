WHAT IT DOES

It pull down the RSS feed from http://sixy.ch/feed
It add other IP address and host names to ips.csv
Uses this to perform the tests for HE.
If test fail it repeats the test.


It is a quick piece of code to the job so it is not very well written so don't be too critical of it, however improvements/feedback to edmundwatson@gmail.com

INSTALLATION/RUNNING 

You need php > 5 (been tested on 5.3.6 and 5.2.17) with curl. If you need to run it on PHP < 5 let me know
It has been tested on Gentoo. 
It also runs on Slug OS 5.3 but some of the command maybe been to be recompiled to give the correct output


place where you want it.

edit the setting.php file with your username, password and directory where you want the working files to go.

# php he.php

and/or add cron task like this

# crontab -e
and add
* 1 * * * /php /%WHERE YOU PUT IT%/he.php >>/var/log/he 2>>/var/log/he
    This will repeat it daily. You may want to increase the frequency if you find it doesn't pass 24 hour on he system.
Outputs to /var/log/he, you may want to turn off debug in he.php if you have a small system, the /var/log/he file doesn't fill up.
